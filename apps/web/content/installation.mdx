description: How to install betteruse in your project
---

Install betteruse using your preferred package manager:

<PackageTabs />

## Requirements

- React 18 or later
- React DOM 18 or later

## TypeScript Support

betteruse is written in TypeScript and ships with complete type definitions. No additional `@types` packages are required.

```tsx
import { useHold } from 'betteruse'
import type { UseHoldOptions, UseHoldReturn } from 'betteruse'
```

## Usage

Import the hooks you need directly from `betteruse`:

```tsx
import { useHold, useIdle, useMeasure, echo } from 'betteruse'
```

Each hook is tree-shakeable, so your bundle will only include the hooks you actually use.

<Callout type="info">
  All hooks are SSR-safe and will not cause hydration mismatches when used with Next.js or other SSR frameworks.
</Callout>

## Next Steps
