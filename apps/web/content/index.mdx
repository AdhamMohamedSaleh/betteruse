**betteruse** is a collection of elegant, SSR-safe React hooks for common UI patterns. Each hook is fully typed, tree-shakeable, and designed to solve real-world problems.

## Why betteruse?

- **Small bundle size**: The entire library is under 5kb gzipped
- **SSR-safe**: All hooks work seamlessly with Next.js, Remix, and other SSR frameworks
- **Fully typed**: Written in TypeScript with complete type definitions
- **Tree-shakeable**: Only import what you need
- **Zero dependencies**: No external runtime dependencies

## Available Hooks

| Hook | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `echo()` | Screen reader announcements |
| `useHold()` | Long press with progress |
| `useExitIntent()` | Exit intent detection |
| `useIdle()` | Idle detection |
| `useSelection()` | Text selection tracking |
| `useMeasure()` | Element measurement |

## Quick Example

```tsx
import { useHold, echo } from 'betteruse'

function DeleteButton() {
  const { handlers, progress, isHolding } = useHold({
    duration: 500,
    onComplete: () => {
      deleteItem()
      echo('Item deleted')
    },
  })

  return (
    <button {...handlers}>
      {isHolding
        ? `Deleting... ${Math.round(progress * 100)}%`
        : 'Hold to Delete'}
    </button>
  )
}
```
